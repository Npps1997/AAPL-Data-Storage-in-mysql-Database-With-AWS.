Based on multiple factors and criteria provided in the dataset, it is aimed at predicting whether a credit card application will be provided or declined. Financial companies are very interested in this classification issue since it can help them speed their application process and lower the risk of granting credit cards to people who might not be able to make their payments.\n"
